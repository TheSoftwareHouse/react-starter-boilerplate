## Quick Start

To start the development, run:

```
mkdir new-project
cd new-project/
git clone https://github.com/TheSoftwareHouse/react-starter-boilerplate.git .
sudo rm -r .git
git init
git remote add origin [your empty project repository]
git remote -v
git add .
git commit -m 'initial commit'
git push origin master
npm install
cd e2e
npm install
cd ..
cp .env.dist .env
cp .env.e2e.dist ./e2e/.env
npm run lint:fix
npm run test
npm run e2e:ci
```

where `new-project` is your desired folder. This should result in cloning the project, setting up your repository as origin and pushing the starter as your initial commit. The linter and tests will be run, to confirm that everything works properly.


## E2E

For E2E testing we are using the [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) framework.

### Details & Reasoning

The configuration is mostly isolated to the e2e folder, to allow for easy removal when not needed and to avoid conflicts with any other testing libraries, as they tend to pollute the global namespace. We believe that proper e2e testing is extremely valuable, but we also recognize that it's not for everyone and it will probably be one of the most removed or ignored features in the boilerplate versions.

To get rid of e2e testing simply delete the e2e directory, the e2e.dist env file, anything beginning with "e2e" from package.json's scripts field and the step named "e2e" from the bitbucket pipelines configuration.

## Environment

### Development

The repository contains a .env.dist file with a list of all env variables used in the application and a .env.e2e.dist file with variables used by the e2e framework. To use on local environment copy .env.dist to root folder as .env and fill any missing variables (`cp .env.dist .env`), to use e2e testing copy .env.e2e.dist to e2e/ folder, rename to .env (`cp .env.e2e.dist ./e2e/.env`) and fill any missing variables.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm lint(:fix)`

Runs the linter (and fixes fixable issues)

### `npm plop`

Runs [Plop JS](https://plopjs.com/) used for generating custom hooks and react components.

### `e2e:run`

Runs Cypress E2E tests in a headless mode (the browser window is not visible)

### `e2e:open`

Opens the Cypress UI, allowing to run and watch E2E tests

### `e2e:ci`

Builds the app as a CI environment, sets up an html server with `npm run serve` and runs the E2E tests in a headless mode. Useful when investigating pipeline failures.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run coverage`

Launches the test runner in the coverage report generation mode.<br />
See [this](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/#coverage-reporting) section for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
