    <h1>Quick Start</h1>
    <p>To start the development, run:</p>
    <pre>
      <div class="code-style">
    mkdir new-project
    cd new-project/
    git clone https://github.com/TheSoftwareHouse/react-starter-boilerplate.git .
    sudo rm -r .git
    git init
    git remote add origin [your empty project repository]
    git remote -v
    git add .
    git commit -m 'initial commit'
    git push origin master
    npm install
    cd e2e
    npm install
    cd ..
    cp .env.dist .env
    cp .env.e2e.dist ./e2e/.env
    npm run lint:fix
    npm run test
    npm run e2e:ci
      </div>
    </pre>
    <p>
      where <code>new-project</code> is your desired folder. This should result in cloning the project, setting up
      your repository
      as origin and pushing the starter as your initial commit. The linter and tests will be run, to confirm that
      everything works properly.
    </p>
    <h2>E2E</h2>
    <p>For E2E testing we are using the <a href="https://www.cypress.io/" target="_blank">Cypress</a> framework.</p>
    <h3>Details & Reasoning</h3>
    <p>The configuration is mostly isolated to the e2e folder, to allow for easy removal when not needed and to avoid
      conflicts with any other testing libraries, as they tend to pollute the global namespace. We believe that proper
      e2e testing is extremely valuable, but we also recognize that it's not for everyone and it will probably be one of
      the most removed or ignored features in the boilerplate versions. </br></br>
      To get rid of e2e testing simply delete the e2e directory, the e2e.dist env file, anything beginning with "e2e"
      from package.json's scripts field and the step named "e2e" from the bitbucket pipelines configuration.</p>
    <h2>Environment</h2>
    <h3>Development</h3>
    <p>The repository contains a .env.dist file with a list of all env variables used in the application and a
      .env.e2e.dist file with variables used by the e2e framework. To use on local environment copy .env.dist to root
      folder as .env and fill any missing variables (<code>cp .env.dist .env</code>), to use e2e testing copy
      .env.e2e.dist to e2e/
      folder, rename to .env ( <code>cp .env.e2e.dist ./e2e/.env</code> ) and fill any missing variables.</p>
    <h2>Available Scripts</h2>
    <p>In the project directory, you can run:</p>
    <code>npm lint(:fix)</code>
    <div class="indentation">
      <p>Runs the linter (and fixes fixable issues)</p>
    </div>
    <code>npm plop</code>
    <div class="indentation">
      <p>Runs <a href="https://plopjs.com/" target="_blank">Plop JS</a> used for generating custom hooks and react components.</p>
    </div>
    <code>e2e:run</code>
    <div class="indentation">
      <p>Runs Cypress E2E tests in a headless mode (the browser window is not visible)</p>
    </div>
    <code>e2e:open</code>
    <div class="indentation">
      <p>Opens the Cypress UI, allowing to run and watch E2E tests</p>
    </div>
    <code>e2e:ci</code>
    <div class="indentation">
      <p>Builds the app as a CI environment, sets up an html server with npm run serve and runs the E2E tests in a
        headless mode. Useful when investigating pipeline failures.</p>
    </div>
    <code>npm start</code>
    <div class="indentation">
      <p>Runs the app in the development mode.</br>
        Open <a href="https://localhost:3000" target="_blank">https://localhost:3000</a> to view it in the browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        The page will reload if you make edits.</br>
        You will also see any lint errors in the console.</p>
    </div>
    <code>npm test</code>
    <div class="indentation">
      <p>Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.</br>
        See the section about <a href="https://vitest.dev/guide/cli.html#vitest" target="_blank">running tests</a> for more information.</p>
    </div>
    <code>npm run coverage</code>
    <div class="indentation">
      <p>Launches the test runner in the coverage report generation mode.</br>
        See <a href="https://vitest.dev/guide/coverage.html" target="_blank">this</a> section for more information.</p>
    </div>
    <code>npm run build</code>
    <div class="indentation">
      <p>Builds the app for production to the build folder.</br>
        It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
      </p>
      <p>The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.</br>
        Your app is ready to be deployed!</p>
      <p>
        See the section about <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html" target="_blank">deployment</a> for more information.</p>
    </div>
    <code>npm run eject</code>
    <p class="warning">Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you <code>eject</code>, you can’t go back!</p>
    <div class="indentation">
      <p>If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command
        will remove the single build dependency from your project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc)
        right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work,
        but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you
        shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you
        couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.</p>

    <h1>Integrating with an API Backend</h1>
    <p>All request to the API should be made using <code>react-fetching-library</code>, which is a simple and powerful
      API client
      for React. Full documentation is available <a href="https://marcin-piela.github.io/react-fetching-library" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>
    <h2>Actions</h2>
    <p>In order to add new request you have to create an <strong>Action</strong> and add it under
      <code>src/api/actions</code> directory. Instead of
      creating plain actions you should export action creators - functions that returns an action based on the arguments
      passed (e.g. payload which should be sent to the API).
    </p>
    <p>
      All actions should be grouped by functionality they represent. Group name, which is also directory name and a
      prefix of file, which helds the action creators, should be in singular form. Good examples of groups are: <code>auth,
        user or article.</code>
    </p>
    <h2>Interceptors</h2>
    <p>In order to create a logic which will be executed on all actions you can create an interceptor. There are two
      types of interceptors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        request interceptors (<a href="https://marcin-piela.github.io/react-fetching-library/#/?id=request-interceptors" target="_blank">read more</a>)
      </li>
      <li>
        response interceptors (<a href="https://marcin-piela.github.io/react-fetching-library/#/?id=response-interceptors" target="_blank">read more</a>)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>the difference between them is that the first one is executed before action is handled by <code>fetch</code> and
      the other one
      is performed on the response returned by the server before it is resolved by a promise.</p>

    <p>All interceptors should be added under <code>src/api/interceptors</code> directory. After creating new
      interceptor you have to
      add it to the fetching client, which is created in <strong>ClientContextController</strong> inside
      <code>src/context/client</code>.
    </p>
    <h2>Mocks</h2>
    <p>If you are working on a new functionality and the backend is not ready yet, you can create a mock which will
      simulate an endpoint and return given response instead of the real one.</p>

    <p> All mocks should be added under <code>src/api/mocks</code> directory, and used in the
      <code>src/api/mocks/mock-server</code> mock server,
      made with <a href="https://mswjs.io/" target="_blank">Mock Service Worker</a>. The mock server is enabled when <strong>NODE_ENV</strong> is not production , or when
      <strong>VITE_CI=1</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2>Types</h2>
    <p>If you would like to modify default <code>react-fetching-library</code> types, you can do it inside <code>src/api/types</code> directory.
      This is perfect place for extending action with additional parameters:</p>
      <pre>
        <div class="code-style">
    import { Action as BaseAction } from 'react-fetching-library';

    export type AdditionalProperties = {
      skipAuthorization?: boolean;
    };

    export type Action<R> = BaseAction<R, AdditionalProperties>;
        </div>
      </pre>
